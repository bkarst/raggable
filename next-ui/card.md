Blurred Card
You can pass the `isBlurred` prop to the card to blur the card. Card gets blurred properties based on its ancestor element.

Note: To achieve the blur effect as seen in the preview, you need to provide a suitable background (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-tr from-[#FFB457] to-[#FF705B]`) to an ancestor element of the Card component allowing the Card's blur effect to be visible.
