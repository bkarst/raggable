## Introduction to Tauri

Tauri is a cross-platform framework that enables developers to build desktop and mobile applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and Rust. Unlike Electron, which bundles a full browser engine, Tauri leverages the system's native webview, resulting in smaller, faster, and more secure applications. Tauri 2.0, known as "The Mobile Update," extends its capabilities to Android and iOS, making it a versatile choice for AI coders targeting multiple platforms.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, and iOS from a single codebase.
- **Small Size**: Apps can be as small as 600KB due to the use of system webviews.
- **Security**: Emphasizes secure development with scoped access and strict policies.
- **Performance**: Rust-powered backend ensures high efficiency.
- **Frontend Independence**: Works with any frontend framework that compiles to HTML, JS, and CSS (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte).

Tauri offers a compelling alternative to Electron, balancing web technology flexibility with native performance and security.

## Getting Started

To start using Tauri 2.0, set up your development environment with the following steps.

### Prerequisites

#### Windows
- **Microsoft C++ Build Tools**: Install with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
- **WebView2**: Required for web rendering; included in Windows 10 version 1803+ or install manually.
- **Rust**: Install via `rustup` from [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org).

#### macOS
- **Xcode**: Install from the App Store or Apple Developer site; includes necessary tools for desktop and iOS development.
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Optional for desktop-only development (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Rust**: Install via `rustup`.

#### Linux
- **Dependencies**: Vary by distribution. For Ubuntu, install `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`, `build-essential`, `curl`, etc.
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential curl
  ```
- **Rust**: Install via `rustup`.

Refer to [Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for detailed setup instructions.

### Installing Tauri CLI

Install the Tauri Command Line Interface (CLI) using Cargo, Rust's package manager:
```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
```

### Creating a New Project

Create a Tauri project with the `create-tauri-app` tool:
```bash
npm create tauri-app
```
Follow the prompts to select your frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue), package manager (npm, Yarn, etc.), and UI template. Alternatively, manually create a project by setting up a `tauri.conf.json` file and integrating your frontend.

---

## Building Your First Application

### Setting Up the Front-End

Tauri supports any frontend framework. After creating a project, your frontend code resides in the `src` directory. For example, with React:
- Edit components in `src/App.jsx`.
- Ensure compatibility with Tauri's development server (e.g., in Vite, set `server.host` to `0.0.0.0` in `vite.config.js` for mobile access).

### Configuring Tauri

The `tauri.conf.json` file in your project root defines app settings:
```json
{
  "tauri": {
    "windows": [
      {
        "title": "My Tauri App",
        "width": 800,
        "height": 600,
        "resizable": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Adjust properties like window size, title, and permissions as needed.

### Running the Application

Launch your app in development mode:
```bash
tauri dev
```
This starts the frontend dev server and opens the app in a native window. For mobile:
- Android: `tauri android dev`
- iOS: `tauri ios dev`

These commands run the app on connected devices or simulators.

## Core Concepts

### Architecture Overview

Tauri applications consist of:
- **Frontend**: Built with web technologies, rendered in the system's webview.
- **Backend**: A Rust binary managing system interactions, communicating with the frontend via inter-process communication (IPC).

This separation ensures a lightweight footprint and native performance.

### Key Components

- **TAO**: A cross-platform windowing library for creating and managing application windows.
- **WRY**: A webview rendering library that interfaces with system webviews (e.g., WebKitGTK on Linux, WebView2 on Windows).

These components enable Tauri to render web content without bundling a browser engine.

---

## Development Workflow

### Development Server

Run `tauri dev` to start a development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), allowing real-time updates without restarting the app. HMR extends to mobile development, enhancing iteration speed on devices and emulators.

### Debugging

- **Web Inspector**: Enable in `tauri.conf.json` (`"devTools": true`) to debug the frontend.
- **Rust Debugging**: Use tools like `gdb` or `lldb` for backend issues.
- **Logging**: Integrate `tauri-plugin-log` for unified frontend and backend logs:
  ```rust
  use tauri::plugin::log::LogPlugin;
  tauri::Builder::default()
      .plugin(LogPlugin::default())
  ```

See [Debugging](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/debugging/) for more techniques.

## API Reference

### Core APIs

Tauri provides APIs for system interactions, accessible via the `invoke` function in the frontend:
- **Window Management**: Create, resize, or close windows.
- **File System**: Read/write files with scoped access.
- **Dialogs**: Display file pickers or message boxes.
- **Notifications**: Send system notifications.

Example:
```javascript
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api';
invoke('show_dialog', { message: 'Hello, Tauri!' });
```

### Plugin APIs

Extend functionality with official plugins:
- `tauri-plugin-sql`: SQL database support.
- `tauri-plugin-store`: Key-value storage.
- `tauri-plugin-upload`: File upload capabilities.

Install plugins via Cargo and configure in your app.

### Custom Commands

Define custom Rust functions to expose to the frontend:
```rust
#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

tauri::Builder::default()
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet])
```
Call from the frontend:
```javascript
invoke('greet', { name: 'AI Coder' }).then(response => console.log(response));
```

## Security

### Security Features

- **Scoped File System Access**: Restricts file operations to predefined directories.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Enforces strict policies to prevent XSS.
- **Isolation Pattern**: Runs untrusted code in a separate context.

### Best Practices

- Validate all user inputs.
- Use HTTPS for remote resources.
- Regularly update dependencies.

### Security Audit

Tauri 2.0 underwent a security audit by Radically Open Security, funded by NLNet. The audit confirmed its robust security model; see the report for details.

---

## Mobile Development

Tauri 2.0 introduces mobile support for Android and iOS.

### Setting Up for Android

- Install Android Studio and the Android SDK.
- Set environment variables (e.g., `ANDROID_HOME`).
- Initialize the project:
  ```bash
  tauri android init
  ```

### Setting Up for iOS

- Install Xcode.
- Initialize the project:
  ```bash
  tauri ios init
  ```

### Mobile-Specific Configurations

Adapt your frontend for mobile:
- Handle touch events.
- Adjust layouts for screen sizes.

### Differences from Desktop

- Mobile apps use device-specific webviews.
- Some APIs require additional permissions (e.g., camera access).

Refer to [Mobile Development](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/mobile/) for comprehensive guides.

## Advanced Topics

### Creating Plugins

Extend Tauri with custom plugins in Rust, Swift (iOS), or Kotlin (Android):
1. Define the plugin in Rust.
2. Implement platform-specific logic.
3. Register in your app.

### Optimizing Application Size

- Minimize frontend assets with tree shaking.
- Use code splitting.
- Avoid large dependencies.

### Integrating with Rust Libraries

Leverage Rust crates in the backend, such as `serde` for serialization or `tokio` for async operations.

### Using Tauri with AI/ML

For AI coders, Tauri supports integration with Rust-based ML libraries:
- **Tch-rs**: Tensor computation for machine learning.
- **Rust-bert**: Natural language processing models.

Example workflow:
1. Train a model in Rust.
2. Expose predictions via custom commands.
3. Build an interactive UI with web technologies.
